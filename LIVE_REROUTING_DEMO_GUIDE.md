# 🚫➡️ Live Rerouting Feature - Demo Guide

## Overview

The **Live Rerouting** feature transforms your static simulation into a truly dynamic system where the AI can react in real-time to track failures. When a track fails, the simulation pauses, affected trains are automatically rerouted, and the simulation resumes with updated paths - all without restarting the entire simulation.

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Phase 1: Backend - Dynamic Disruption Handling

1. **Enhanced Network Model**
   - `disable_track()` and `enable_track()` methods with metadata tracking
   - Improved train identification for affected routes
   - Live route recalculation for specific trains only

2. **Live Rerouting API**
   - Enhanced `/api/track-failure` endpoint with real-time rerouting
   - `/api/tracks` endpoint for UI track selection
   - Affected train identification and route optimization

### ✅ Phase 2: Frontend - Interactive Control & Visualization

3. **Simulation Pause/Resume**
   - Automatic pause when track failure occurs
   - Resume after rerouting completion
   - Real-time status indicators

4. **Track Failure UI**
   - Track selection dropdown with operational tracks
   - Live rerouting status feedback
   - Success/failure reporting with detailed metrics

5. **Visual Disruption Indicators**
   - Failed tracks shown in red with dashed lines
   - Failure icons and timestamps
   - Dynamic legend updates

6. **Route Updates**
   - Trains follow new visual paths automatically
   - Seamless transition without simulation restart
   - Rerouting impact visualization

## 🚀 How to Demo the Feature

### Step 1: Start the System

1. **Backend**: Start the Flask server
   ```bash
   cd trainSch
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Frontend**: Start the React development server
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

### Step 2: Load the Simulation

1. Click **"Load Schedule"** in the Control Panel
2. Wait for the enhanced schedule to load
3. Click **"Start Simulation"** to begin train movement
4. Observe trains moving along their scheduled routes

### Step 3: Trigger a Live Track Failure

1. In the Control Panel, locate the **"Live Track Management"** section
2. Click **"Report Track Failure"** (⚡ button)
3. Select a track that has active trains (e.g., `NDLS_ANVR_MAIN`)
4. Add an optional description (e.g., "Signal malfunction")
5. Click **"Report Failure"**

### Step 4: Observe the Live Rerouting Process

**Real-time sequence you'll see:**

1. **Immediate Pause**: 
   - Simulation freezes instantly
   - "Simulation Paused" indicator appears
   - Reason: "Track failure: [track_id]"

2. **Visual Track Update**:
   - Failed track turns **red** with dashed lines
   - Track label shows "❌ FAILED" status
   - Tooltip displays failure reason and timestamp

3. **AI Processing**:
   - Backend identifies affected trains
   - Calculates new optimal routes
   - Returns rerouting information

4. **Route Updates**:
   - Affected trains get new visual paths
   - Routes update seamlessly (no restart needed)
   - Success metrics displayed in modal

5. **Automatic Resume**:
   - After 2 seconds, simulation resumes
   - Trains continue on their new routes
   - System status returns to normal

### Step 5: Verify the Results

**Check the results:**

- **Network Graph**: Failed track appears in red
- **Train Paths**: Affected trains follow new routes
- **Console Logs**: Detailed rerouting information
- **Modal Feedback**: Success metrics and affected train list

## 🎬 Demo Script

### "The Live Rerouting Story"

> *"Let me show you how R-Vision handles real-world disruptions with Live Rerouting. We start with our normal railway operations - trains moving along their scheduled paths. But what happens when something goes wrong?"*

1. **Set the Scene**: Point out trains moving normally
2. **The Crisis**: "Let's say there's a signal failure on the main NDLS-ANVR line"
3. **The Response**: Click "Report Track Failure" and select the track
4. **The Magic**: Watch the pause → reroute → resume sequence
5. **The Result**: "Notice how affected trains now take alternative routes, the failed track is clearly marked, and everything continues seamlessly"

### Key Points to Highlight

1. **No Manual Intervention**: AI handles everything automatically
2. **Real-time Response**: Immediate pause and processing
3. **Visual Clarity**: Clear indication of failed infrastructure
4. **Seamless Resume**: No need to restart the simulation
5. **Intelligent Routing**: Trains take optimal alternative paths

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Backend Flow
```
Track Failure Report → Identify Affected Trains → Disable Track → 
Calculate New Routes → Update Train Paths → Return Results
```

### Frontend Flow
```
User Action → Pause Simulation → Send API Request → 
Update Train Routes → Update Visualization → Resume Simulation
```

### Key Components

- **`reportTrackFailure()`**: Main orchestration function
- **`pauseSimulation()`**: Immediate response handler
- **`updateTrainRoutes()`**: Route update processor
- **`NetworkGraph`**: Visual failure indicators
- **`TrackFailureModal`**: User interface

## 🎯 Demo Tips

### Best Tracks to Fail for Maximum Impact

1. **`NDLS_ANVR_MAIN`**: Major route with multiple trains
2. **`ANVR_GZB_MAIN`**: High-traffic corridor
3. **`NDLS_SHZM_DIRECT`**: Alternative route demonstration

### What to Watch For

- **Pause Speed**: Simulation stops immediately
- **Visual Changes**: Track color changes to red
- **Route Adaptation**: Trains take different paths
- **Smooth Resume**: No jarring transitions

### Troubleshooting

- **No Trains Affected**: Try a busier track
- **Route Not Found**: Some trains may not have alternatives
- **API Errors**: Check backend console for details

## 🌟 Advanced Features

### Multiple Failures
- Report multiple track failures to see complex rerouting
- Observe how routes adapt to increasingly constrained network

### Recovery Simulation
- Implement track repair functionality
- Show network returning to optimal routing

### Strategy Integration
- Combine with Multi-Strategy simulation
