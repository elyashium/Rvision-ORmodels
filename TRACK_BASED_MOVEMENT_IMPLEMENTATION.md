# Track-Based Train Movement Implementation

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Issue**: Trains were moving in straight lines between stations, ignoring the actual railway tracks/edges defined in the vis-network graph structure.

**Solution**: Implemented proper track-based movement where trains follow the actual network edges and can handle multi-hop routes through intermediate stations.

## ✅ Implementation Details

### **1. Enhanced Track Detection**

```javascript
const findTrackBetweenStations = (startStation, endStation, networkData) => {
  // Direct track lookup
  for (const [trackId, track] of Object.entries(networkData.tracks)) {
    if (track.from === startStation && track.to === endStation) {
      return { trackId, track, isDirect: true };
    }
  }
  
  // Multi-hop route lookup using route_alternatives
  const routeInfo = networkData.route_alternatives[`${startStation}_to_${endStation}`];
  if (routeInfo) {
    return { 
      trackId: primaryRoute[0], 
      track: networkData.tracks[primaryRoute[0]], 
      isDirect: false,
      fullRoute: primaryRoute
    };
  }
}
```

### **2. Multi-Point Path Generation**

```javascript
const getEdgePath = (fromStation, toStation, networkData, trackInfo) => {
  if (trackInfo.fullRoute && trackInfo.fullRoute.length > 1) {
    // Create path through intermediate stations
    const pathPoints = [fromCoords];
    
    for (const trackId of trackInfo.fullRoute) {
      const track = networkData.tracks[trackId];
      const intermediateCoords = getStationCoordinates(track.from, networkData);
      pathPoints.push(intermediateCoords);
    }
    
    pathPoints.push(toCoords);
    return { path: pathPoints };
  }
  
  // Fallback to direct path
  return { path: [fromCoords, toCoords] };
};
```

### **3. Advanced Path Interpolation**

```javascript
const interpolateAlongPath = (pathPoints, progress) => {
  if (pathPoints.length === 2) {
    // Simple two-point interpolation
    return {
      x: start.x + (end.x - start.x) * progress,
      y: start.y + (end.y - start.y) * progress
    };
  }
  
  // Multi-segment path interpolation
  const totalLength = calculatePathLength(pathPoints);
  const targetDistance = totalLength * progress;
  
  // Find the correct segment and interpolate within it
  let currentDistance = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < pathPoints.length - 1; i++) {
    const segmentLength = calculateSegmentLength(pathPoints[i], pathPoints[i + 1]);
    
    if (currentDistance + segmentLength >= targetDistance) {
      const segmentProgress = (targetDistance - currentDistance) / segmentLength;
      return interpolateSegment(pathPoints[i], pathPoints[i + 1], segmentProgress);
    }
    
    currentDistance += segmentLength;
  }
};
```

## 🚂 Key Features Implemented

### **1. Track-Based Movement**
- ✅ Trains now follow actual network edges instead of straight lines
- ✅ Supports both direct tracks and multi-hop routes
- ✅ Uses `route_alternatives` from `network_graph.json` for complex routing

### **2. Realistic Route Following**
- ✅ Trains can travel through intermediate stations
- ✅ Multi-segment path interpolation for complex routes
- ✅ Proper track identification and validation

### **3. Enhanced Visualization**
- ✅ Tooltip shows current track ID that train is using
- ✅ Console logging for track routing debugging
- ✅ Clear indication of direct vs multi-hop routes

### **4. Robust Fallback System**
- ✅ Falls back to direct line if no track route found
- ✅ Graceful handling of missing track data
- ✅ Warning messages for invalid routes

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Station Coordinate System**
```javascript
const getStationCoordinates = (stationId, networkData) => {
  if (networkData?.stations?.[stationId]) {
    const coords = networkData.stations[stationId].coordinates;
    // Convert lat/lon to vis-network coordinates
    const x = (coords.lon - 77.2197) * 10000;
    const y = (coords.lat - 28.6431) * 10000;
    return { x, y };
  }
  // Fallback coordinates for missing data
  return fallbackCoords[stationId] || { x: 0, y: 0 };
};
```

### **Route Resolution Logic**
1. **Direct Track**: Look for `track.from === startStation && track.to === endStation`
2. **Alternative Routes**: Check `route_alternatives` for multi-hop paths
3. **Primary Route**: Use the primary route defined in alternatives
4. **Alternative Routes**: Fall back to alternative routes if primary fails
5. **Direct Line**: Ultimate fallback to straight-line movement

## 📊 Network Graph Integration

### **Track Data Structure**
```json
{
  "tracks": {
    "NDLS_ANVR_MAIN": {
      "from": "NDLS",
      "to": "ANVR", 
      "distance_km": 15.2,
      "track_type": "double_line"
    }
  },
  "route_alternatives": {
    "NDLS_to_GZB": {
      "primary": ["NDLS_ANVR_MAIN", "ANVR_GZB_MAIN"],
      "alternatives": [
        ["NDLS_SBB_ALT", "SBB_GZB_ALT"]
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### **Enhanced Train Tooltips**
- 🚆 Train ID and Type
- 📍 Current Status and Location
- 🛤️ **Current Track ID** (NEW)
- 🗺️ Complete Journey Route
- 📊 Progress Percentage
- ⏰ Delay Information

## 🎯 Result

### **Before**
- ❌ Trains floated randomly between stations
- ❌ No respect for actual railway infrastructure
- ❌ Direct line movement ignoring network topology

### **After**
- ✅ Trains follow actual railway tracks defined in the network
- ✅ Support for complex multi-hop routes through intermediate stations
- ✅ Realistic movement that respects railway infrastructure
- ✅ Enhanced tooltips showing which track trains are currently using
- ✅ Robust fallback system for missing track data

## 🚀 Visual Impact

Users now see:
1. **Realistic Movement**: Trains follow the exact paths shown as edges in the vis-network
2. **Track Information**: Hover over trains to see which specific track they're using
3. **Route Complexity**: Support for trains that travel through multiple intermediate stations
4. **Infrastructure Awareness**: Movement that respects the actual railway network topology

This creates a much more convincing and realistic simulation that accurately represents how trains actually move through a railway network! 🚂✨
