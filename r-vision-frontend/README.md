## Design Philosophy

### **Modern Control Center Aesthetic**
- **Dark Theme**: Deep blues and blacks for professional look
- **Subtle Glows**: Rail-blue accents with shadow effects
- **Clean Typography**: JetBrains Mono for technical precision
- **Intuitive Layout**: Logical information hierarchy
- **Responsive Design**: Fluid across different screen sizes

### **Color Palette**
- `rail-dark`: #0a0f1c (Primary background)
- `rail-darker`: #050914 (Secondary background)
- `rail-blue`: #1e3a8a (Primary accent)
- `rail-light-blue`: #3b82f6 (Interactive elements)
- `rail-accent`: #06b6d4 (Highlights)
- `rail-success`: #10b981 (Success states)
- `rail-warning`: #f59e0b (Warning states)
- `rail-danger`: #ef4444 (Error states)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (Note: some warnings about engine compatibility are expected but don't affect functionality)
- R-Vision Backend running on `http://localhost:5001`

### Installation

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd r-vision-frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Backend Integration

Ensure the R-Vision backend is running:

```bash
# In the root project directory
python app.py
```

The backend should be accessible at `http://localhost:5001`

## Usage Guide

### 1. **System Initialization**
1. Click "Load Schedule" to initialize the railway network
2. Wait for the system to load train data and network topology
3. Verify system status shows "Healthy" with active trains

### 2. **Start Simulation**
1. After loading schedule, click "Start Simulation"
2. Watch trains move along their routes in real-time
3. Monitor system metrics in the header

### 3. **Report Disruptions**
1. Click "Report Disruption" in the control panel
2. Select affected train from dropdown
3. Choose event type (delay, track failure, etc.)
4. Enter delay duration and optional details
5. Submit to trigger AI optimization

### 4. **AI Recommendations**
1. After reporting a disruption, check the "AI Recommendations" tab
2. Review the optimization suggestion and impact analysis
3. Accept the recommendation or choose manual override
4. Monitor the results in the alerts feed

### 5. **Network Visualization**
- **Zoom**: Use zoom controls or mouse wheel
- **Pan**: Click and drag to move around
- **Fullscreen**: Click fullscreen button for detailed view
- **Train Tracking**: Active trains show as red triangles moving along routes
- **Station Types**: Different shapes indicate station importance
- **Track Status**: Line colors show track types and conditions

## API Integration

The frontend integrates with the following backend endpoints:

- `GET /api/state` - Current network state
- `GET /api/trains` - All train information
- `GET /api/system-info` - System configuration
- `POST /api/report-event` - Report train disruptions
- `POST /api/reset` - Reset simulation
- `POST /api/accept-recommendation` - Accept AI recommendations

## Customization

### **Theme Colors**
Modify colors in `tailwind.config.js` under the `extend.colors` section.

### **Network Layout**
Update station positions and track connections in `NetworkGraph.jsx` within the `getNetworkData()` function.

### **Animation Speed**
Adjust train movement speed by modifying the timing in the `getTrainPosition()` function.

## Troubleshooting

### **Backend Connection Issues**
- Ensure Flask backend is running on port 5001
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Verify `API_BASE_URL` in `apiService.js`

### **Network Graph Not Loading**
- Check vis-network dependency installation
- Verify network container ref is properly attached
- Look for JavaScript errors in browser console

### **Styling Issues**
- Ensure Tailwind CSS is properly configured
- Check that custom CSS classes are defined in `index.css`
- Verify PostCSS configuration

## Development Notes

### **Performance Considerations**
- Network graph physics disabled for better performance
- Train position updates throttled to prevent excessive re-renders
- Alert and recommendation arrays limited to prevent memory bloat

### **Browser Compatibility**
- Tested on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge
- Requires modern JavaScript features (ES6+)
- CSS Grid and Flexbox used extensively

### **Future Enhancements**
- WebSocket integration for real-time updates
- More sophisticated train animation along actual track paths
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Export functionality for reports and visualizations
